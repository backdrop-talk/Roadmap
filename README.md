# Roadmap
Take part in the plans to move Backdrop into the future!

The Backdrop Roadmap is an action plan for the project as a whole and discussions around where the community thinks it should go.

If you have some ideas, we want to hear them! Maybe you love where things are going and want to help out, this is a great place to get involved!

**Where to start...**

1) If you want to discuss things, head over to the Discussions tab.

2) If you want to add or ammend a policy, create an issue in the Issue tab.

3) If you want to see the progress of any outstanding issues, check out the Project tab.
